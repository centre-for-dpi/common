  Basic, indicative financials (back of envelope estimates) of building DPI
  under two methods of implementation

# üí≤ How much does it cost to build DPI?

Digital public Infrastructure can be brought to life in a country  in two ways:

1. **Greenfield DPI implementations:** when the entire infrastructure is built from scratch through a fresh private procurement route&#x20;
2. **Rapid DPI upgrades**: when existing infrastructure is enhanced with +1 blocks to convert them into powerful DPI. For example, converting an existing physical or digital ID or document into a digitally verifiable identity  by including a digitally signed QR code on it, or converting a large database into a registry by opening up its APIs for others to use.&#x20;

The costs associated with both these approaches can vary significantly.

1. **Greenfield systems from scratch**&#x20;

The cost of building a national ID enrolment/registration and database management infrastructure , for example, under the first approach would be a multi-million dollar investment estimated at $1-5 enrolment costs per person plus some fixed costs of maintaining the system.&#x20;

Similarly, the startup cost to build a P2P / P2M payment system from scratch would typically be in the realm of $2-4 million (plus maintenance costs annually), requiring investments from a consortium of banks if a payment switch operator is driving it (or by the central bank if they choose to operate it themselves). These costs typically have an extremely high RoI - as mature payments systems move billions of dollars in commerce monthly/annually.&#x20;

\
2\. **Rapid Upgrades to existing Digital Assets**

Yet most countries aren‚Äôt starting from scratch. Improvements to existing fast payments rails to support payments systems to operate as DPI (e.g. by inserting a QR code specification to make existing wallets and payment providers interoperable; upgrading the API specifications to allow third party app payment initiation; introducing a standard mode of authentication for third party apps to complete payments; creating multi-party dispute resolution via open APIs;  etc. **could cost only a few hundred thousand dollars for the entire project (including tech and program costs)** depending on the design.\


Countries often already have some type of physical or digital infrastructure in place and hence **fall under the second category for most DPI implementations.**&#x20;

Based on our costing model, ‚ÄúConversion‚Äù DPI building blocks such as verifiable credentials (data sharing), ID auth / eSign / eKYC (layers on top of ID), G2P mapper (payments / social benefit delivery) would **typically require around $750k +/- 15%** (depending on the country context) over six months to roll out a high value and reusable DPI at scale when built on existing systems.&#x20;

Extending or deepening the implementation to add additional use cases over a 12 month period (illustrating the multi-domain impact of DPI) could cost around $1.3 Million (+/- 15%) in total. The costs of augmenting national P2P/P2M payment systems varies more based on the scope/capabilities of the existing system.&#x20;

In case countries wish to build these blocks to demonstrate quick wins with powerful last mile benefits, they could also consider the [DaaS Program](https://docs.cdpi.dev/initiatives/dpi-as-a-packaged-solution-daas) and **receive support from private philanthropic sources and open source  DPI packages necessary to roll-out these capabilities.**&#x20;



<mark style="background-color:orange;">Some DPI cost the taxpayer almost nothing!</mark>

If a country just publishes a [standard](https://docs.cdpi.dev/references/home) to drive an interoperable open network - let‚Äôs say for **data sharing** (for credential issuance schema, or for registry access APIs, or for consented personal data sharing); or for **discovery and fulfilment** (publication of open APIs for government services including filing taxes; open standards for discovery of any good or service (such as BeckN); or **payments** (publishing interoperable QR standard for market to follow; cash in cash out standard for interoperable cash withdrawal); then the team in charge just has to review the existing standards and publish a paper outlining the update.&#x20;

This is a **3-4 week process with no additional technical implementation cost** as the market players do the deployment.&#x20;

It is famously said,

> "Building DPI requires deep conviction and not deep pockets."
