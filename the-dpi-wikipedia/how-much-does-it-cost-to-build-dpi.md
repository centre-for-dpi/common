  Basic, indicative financials of building DPI under two methods of
  implementation

# üí≤ How much does it cost to build DPI?

Digital public Infrastructure can be brought to life in a country  in two ways:

1. **Greenfield DPI implementations:** when the entire infrastructure is built from scratch through a fresh private procurement route&#x20;
2. **Rapid DPI upgrades:** when existing infrastructure is enhanced with +1 blocks to convert them into powerful DPI. For example, converting an existing physical or digital ID or document into a digitally verifiable identity  by including a digitally signed QR code on it, or converting a large database into a registry by opening up its APIs for others to use.&#x20;

The costs associated with both these approaches can vary significantly.

The cost of building a national ID, for example, under the first approach would be a multi-million dollar investment ball-parked at $1-5 per person plus some fixed costs (for further details, please refer to [this guide](https://id4d.worldbank.org/Cost-Model) from the World Bank). However, upgrading an existing physical ID with a digitally signed QR code would be a few hundred thousand dollars.&#x20;

\
Similarly, the startup cost to build a P2P / P2M payment system from scratch would typically be in the realm of $2-4 million (plus maintenance costs annually), requiring investments from a consortium of banks if a payment switch operator is driving it. These costs typically have an extremely high RoI - as mature payments systems move billions of dollars in commerce monthly/annually. However, improvements to existing fast payments rails to support payments systems to operate as DPI (e.g. by inserting a QR code specification to make existing wallets and payment providers interoperable) could cost only a few hundred thousand dollars for the entire project (including tech and program costs).&#x20;

\
Countries often already have some type of physical or digital infrastructure in place and hence fall under the second category for most DPI implementations.&#x20;

Based on our costing model, ‚ÄúConversion‚Äù DPI building blocks such as verifiable credentials (data sharing), ID auth / eSign / eKYC (layers on top of ID), G2P mapper (payments / social benefit delivery) would only require around $750k +/- 15% (depending on the country context) over six months to roll out a high value and reusable DPI at scale when built on existing systems.&#x20;

Extending or deepening the implementation to add additional use cases over a 12 month period (illustrating the multi-domain impact of DPI) could cost around $1.3 Million (+/- 15%) in total.&#x20;

\
In case countries wish to build these blocks to demonstrate quick wins with powerful last mile benefits, they could also consider the [DaaS Program](https://docs.cdpi.dev/initiatives/dpi-as-a-packaged-solution-daas) and receive support from private philanthropic sources and open source  DPI packages necessary to roll-out these capabilities.
