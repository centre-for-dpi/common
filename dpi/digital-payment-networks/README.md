# ðŸ’¸ Payments

Payments are the lifeblood of an economy. Without frictionless and low cost digital payments, commerce is bottlenecked. When payments are largely cash-based without viable digital alternatives,

1. **Remote commerce and eCommerce suffers** (particularly in the face of physical restrictions or remoteness barriers such as those imposed by COVID); and&#x20;
2. **Physical commerce faces higher frictions** and challenges (loss of value due to lack of availability of exact change, increased likelihood of robberies/theft, etc).

While digital payments are not new, a DPI approach is distinct from existing types of digital payments in it they creates **inclusion, innovation, and unprecedented scale of access** that allows for diverse user experiences (over smartphone, feature phones, or no-phones).&#x20;

To ask whether the payments in your country is operating as a Digital Public Infrastructure, simply answer this: is a majority of the population in my country, (particularly those of lower incomes) able to access and regularly use a reliable means of digital payment at affordable cost to them? If not, and a payments system is used only by the elite sections of a country while much of the population prefers/relies on cash, **there is scope in your country for a DPI transformation in payments** that could catalyse the digital economy.&#x20;

In particular, we explore 5 powerful payments interventions to trigger a DPI transformation:&#x20;
