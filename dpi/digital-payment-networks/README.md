# ðŸ’¸ Payments

Payments are the lifeblood of an economy. Without frictionless payments, commerce stalls. When payments are largely cash-based without viable digital alternatives,

1. **Remote commerce and ecommerce suffers** (particularly in the face of physical restrictions or remoteness barriers); and&#x20;
2. **Physical commerce faces higher frictions** and challenges (loss of value due to lack of availability of exact change, increased likelihood of robberies/theft, etc).

While digital payments are not new, a DPI approach is distinct from existing types of digital payments in it they creates **inclusion, innovation, and unprecedented scale of access** that allows for diverse user experiences (over smartphone, feature phones, or no-phones).&#x20;
