# ðŸ›’ Discovery & Fulfilment

A DPI approach to Discovery and Fulfilment represents the capability to avail of any service or purchase any good across multiple apps in an interoperable manner. This can include:&#x20;

1. **Open APIs for government services** such as tax filing or business registration
2. **A shared protocol for purchase of goods or services** across sectors (such as [BeckN](https://becknprotocol.io/)) including for use cases such as:
   1. Open Mobility/Transport&#x20;
   2. Open eCommerce (Buyers and sellers can search any app)
   3. Open Financial Services network (view loans/insurance products across any app)&#x20;
