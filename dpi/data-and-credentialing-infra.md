# ðŸ“‚ Data Sharing and AI/ML Models

The ability to create value from data is especially crucial to those individuals, entities, and societies who may be data rich even before they are financially rich or healthy.

A DPI approach to data sharing can include the following possible use cases:&#x20;

1. The ability to generate **Credentials** for key certificates/claims in a digital society (eg. proof of education; proof of business registration; proof of work experience, proof of vaccination, etc.) &#x20;
2. The ability to share **personal data in a secure and consented manner** bilaterally with a party offering me a service on the basis of the data (eg a health diagnosis, a loan, a recommendation, etc.)
3. The ability for a society to generate **open anonymised datasets** to enable research or trends assessments across various sectors&#x20;
4. The ability to publish **open AI/ML models** that can be used to better enable access to services based on data, e.g. real time language translation models; financial underwriting models; etc.&#x20;
