# 🔏 Signatures & Consent

Three key components make up this DPI category:&#x20;

1. **Digital Signatures or PKI:** To ensure a document/certificate/data packet hasn't been tampered with, a nation needs to generate the capability to affix a verifiable digital signature. &#x20;
2. **eSignatures:** The ability of an individual or entity to electronically sign a document digitally (via mobile) to indicate agreement&#x20;
3. **Granular Consent:** The ability of an individual to indicate their consent to share data for a specific purpose and time period with an indicated third party, and generate an auditable and digitally signed consent artefact to indicate that intent. &#x20;
