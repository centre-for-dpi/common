# ðŸš€ DPI as a Packaged Solution (DaaS)

In many ways, 2023 was labeled as â€˜The Year of DPIâ€™ (at least for those who work in government, the development sector, or tech-policy institutions!). This year, a concept relatively new in terminology but fairly mature in global practice was brought to the forefront as a powerful strategy to accelerate socioeconomic growth.  It was able to not only withstand the scrutiny of top bureaucrats, policy leaders, and private entrepreneurs across the globe but also fostered a global consensus on the suggested principles for building DPI - which is a rare feat!

Of course, now that there is consensus on the need to build DPI to accelerate growth and development, it falls on the executors in countries - <mark style="background-color:purple;">**how do we build DPI at an accelerated pace to benefit citizens?**</mark>
