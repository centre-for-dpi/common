# DPI Implementation & Execution Guidance

1. **Don’t aim for perfection before beginning.** Universal adoption or aligning all partners on board (especially large incumbents) is almost never possible at first. Start anyway with a ‘coalition of the willing’ as early adopters and build from there - more will come over time. Target some political support eventually, but not necessarily whole of government alignment at the start.&#x20;

\


2. **Don’t leave all of the ‘how’ to technology vendors.** Think through blueprints which include interoperability standards that create boundaries and roles for technology partners where they can excel, rather than outsourcing all of the design thinking to a partner.&#x20;

\


3. **Small improvements (+1) Thinking to drive adoption.** Rather than launching grand new projects or initiatives, ask what small (+1) changes across systems and ideas that already exist can help convert an existing digital system to ensure feasibility. Accept the reality of asynchronous adoption!

\


4. &#x20;**Small teams, high ownership.** Particularly in early phases, DPI execution typically requires small teams that drive actions across an ecosystem, rather than unwieldy large central teams with dispersed ownership.&#x20;

\


5. &#x20;**Design for system failures:** Treat power outages, misaligned incentives,  connectivity gaps, and other constraints as not the exception but as expected - and build options and safeguards, and multi-modal access to ensure resilience.&#x20;

\


6. &#x20;**Frame arguments from the counterparty institution’s point of view, not from the DPI builder point of view.**  Adoption by multiple stakeholders with different institutional positions and interests is essential to DPI. A market player, a regulator, a government department, or may have a different reason to adopt a DPI building block - frame it from their goals and interests rather than yours.

\


7. &#x20;**Parallel rather than consecutive phasing.** It is tempting to wait for one phase to complete before beginning another - e.g waiting for ID registration to complete before testing authentication, or waiting for registries to be completed before building transactions/ service fulfillment networks in a sector. But if you have minimised the components of DPI to bare essentials, build them out in parallel as much as possible to avoid late surprises.&#x20;

\


8. **Design architecture for tomorrow, but implement use cases for today** based on political will and societal demand. For instance, you should architect a payments system that allows for multiple currencies even if cross border is unlikely on day one; or you should allow for multiple modes of authentication in a data sharing ecosystem even if one mode is the default based on current technology.&#x20;

\


9. &#x20;**Test and debug early.** No digital project is perfect on day one. Your DPI will get to 40-50% coverage based on high quality architecture and design, but will not reach critical mass without consistent bug fixing, catching errors, and continuous improvement. Seek constant market feedback on the usage of the DPI block especially in early stages. Target early sampling, sandboxes, and hackathons in small pilots, as well as drive consultations with key players to ensure iterative improvements of the approach and wide adoption at scale.

\


10. **Leverage reusable open source where possible.** The quality and availability of open source in this space has taken a leap in the last few years -  take advantage of it to build faster and cheaper. If you prefer to build in-house or via a vendor, ensure your build reviews and absorbs relevant learnings from the available open source models.

\


11. &#x20;**Impatient with actions, but patient with results.** Large scale societal transformations may take time (especially at the start, when the progress seems invisible) before developing enough ‘escape velocity’ to scale. Be patient while staying determined to make the next right step, and don’t worry about getting quick vanity metrics in early stages.&#x20;

\


12. &#x20;**Be prepared to act fast in policy windows.** It is crucial to work consistently on a DPI, build a coalition, and demo/test building blocks even when there is no policy window or political will in sight. Only the prepared can take advantage of an unexpected opportunity, crisis, or other policy window to drive scale-up!&#x20;
