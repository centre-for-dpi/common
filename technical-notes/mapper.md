# Mapper

One of the core design principles of Digital Public Infrastructure is to enable choice. Choice to user/beneficiairy, regulators, private / public entities, service providers, etc., to use digital rails to deliver services.

For e.g., digitial rails include identity platfrom auth/eKyc APIs, payment APIs, data consent / sharing APIs, address mapper APIs, etc., that allow cross sector (health, education, agriculture, social benefits, etc.,) use cases.

Address Mapper is a simple lookup registry to enable easy identification of user/beneficiary account detials using aliases. Usually the lookup is against foundational or functional ID to an account. In an idealistic privacy conscious scenario both the lookup key and value can be aliases and respective platforms/systems enable actual ID/account resolution on need to know basis.The Address Maper design / specifications also allows managing the primary id/account details as well.

Address Mapper as a digital rail for each sector can be managed to enable ecosystem play and provide choice to the customer. Reference technical architecutre to financial/payment sector is part of G2P Connect specifications [here](https://g2p-connect.gitbook.io/docs/g2p-connect-protocol/interfaces/beneficiary-management/mapperarchitecture)
