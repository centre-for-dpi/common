# Mapper

One of the core design outcomes of Digital Public Infrastructure is to enable choice. Choice to user/beneficiary, regulators, private / public entities, service providers, etc., to use digital rails to deliver services.

For e.g., Digital rails include identity platform auth/eKyc APIs, payment APIs, data consent / sharing APIs,  etc., that allow cross-sector (health, education, agriculture, social benefits, etc.,) use cases.

[Address Mapper](https://g2p-connect.gitbook.io/docs/g2p-connect-protocol/interfaces/beneficiary-management/mapperarchitecture) is a simple lookup registry to enable easy identification of user/beneficiary account details using aliases. Usually the lookup is against foundational or functional ID to an account. In an idealistic privacy conscious scenario both the lookup key and value can be aliases and respective platforms/systems enable actual ID/account resolution on need to know basis.The Address Mapper design / specifications also allows managing the primary id/account details as well.

Address Mapper as a digital rail for each sector can be managed to enable ecosystem play and provide choice to the customer. Reference technical architecture to financial/payment sector is part of **G2P Connect** specifications [here](https://g2p-connect.gitbook.io/docs/g2p-connect-protocol/interfaces/beneficiary-management/mapperarchitecture/mapperspecs)
