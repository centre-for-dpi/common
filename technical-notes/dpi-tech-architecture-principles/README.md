The five technology architecture principles above illustrate how DPI efforts can be architected to be distinct from traditional digitisation efforts: 1) [interoperability](interoperability.md); 2) [minimalist, reusable building blocks](minimalist-and-reusable-building-blocks.md); 3) [Diverse, inclusive innovation](diverse-inclusive-innovation.md) by the ecosystem; 4) a preference for remaining [federated and decentralised](federated-and-decentralised-by-design.md); and 5) [security & privacy](security-and-privacy-by-design.md) by design.

When implemented, these technical principles help DPIs achieve societal outcomes such as inclusion, user choice, innovation, scale of delivery, speed of services, public trust, competition in markets, and others as outlined below.
