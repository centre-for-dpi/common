# Innovation

## Overview _(What to aim for)_

Enable Diverse Innovation by the ecosystem.

Allow others (public and private innovators) to build solutions and services using the DPI at scale (akin to highways or the Internet) instead of DPI providers building the entire solution in a monolithic fashion.

Enable innovation both by ‘challenger’ market players in the financial ecosystem and by incumbents.

Enable diversity of innovation across online and offline, self-service and assisted, and in smartphone/feature phone/ no-phone modes. This is essential to balance inclusion and innovation, thus addressing scale and adaptability/sustainability over time.

Private Innovation can be leveraged both in building the DPI and in leveraging the DPI in a wider digital economy to offer solutions.

Adoption and innovation should be voluntary and demand-led.
