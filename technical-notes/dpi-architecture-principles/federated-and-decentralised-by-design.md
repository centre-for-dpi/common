# Federated & Decentralised by Design

## Overview _(What to aim for)_

Avoid centralisation. Allow for federated databases/systems where possible that are each reusable & accessible by the individual (multiple functional identities, modes of payments, sources of data etc.). This prevents creation of honey pots (cybersecurity risk) and over-aggregation of information into unwieldy large central databases (a privacy risk).

In today’s world, it is perfectly possible to connect various systems via common protocols and standards and still achieve unification without centralization.&#x20;



## **Technical Tools **_**(How to achieve it)**_&#x20;

* [ ] ”Wrapper” APIs above disparate existing systems rather than new large centralised databases.

## **Societal Outcomes **_**(Why it matters)**_

* [ ] Autonomy of Institutions
* [ ] Cybersecurity
* [ ] Individual Privacy
* [ ] Resilience - avoid overdependence on any one system
