# eSign

eSignatures can be built as a capability on top of any identity system. They allow for an individual to avoid a physical or wet signature, and instead sign a document remotely using a method of identity authentication. These documents could include loan agreements, property ownership agreements, or closure of business documents for instance.&#x20;

eSignature is a protocol that can allow an ecosystem of electronic signature providers to facilitate legally valid signatures as a service to various public and private institutions, typically building on an existing identity authentication and eKYC API.&#x20;

An example eSign ecosystem could be architected as follows:&#x20;
