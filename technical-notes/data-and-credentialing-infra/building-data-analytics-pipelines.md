# Building Data Analytics Pipelines

Imagine you’re a technical analyst or decision-maker wanting to better understand and predict regional migration flows. For that, you would need to collect and integrate anonymized data from different national open portals and internal management systems to generate regional data intelligence.

What would you need to consider in your data analytics architecture? This exact question we got asked by an international cooperation agency. Here are some insights from that exchange, that can be extrapolated to any other data management initiative.

When it comes to sharing data, the approach varies by region. Some adhere to open data policies, allowing for the free distribution of datasets, while others might implement additional controls based on data sensitivity.&#x20;

The architecture for processing these datasets typically involves data pipelines, which can be custom-built, adopted from open-source projects, or sourced from licensed solutions.

With anonymized datasets readily available through open portals the orchestration of technical actions to process data in real time becomes the main challenge. This is what we call the Data Value Chain. More specifically, these are the techniques you’d need to put in place:&#x20;

1. Data ingestion: Collecting data from various sources.
2. Data clean-up: Removing inaccuracies or irrelevant information.
3. Data transformation: Converting data into a suitable format for analysis.
4. Data Analysis: Analyzing data to derive insights.
5. Storage: Keeping data in databases or storage systems.
6. Querying: Retrieving specific data from storage.
7. Visualization: Representing data graphically for easier interpretation.
8. Sharing: Distributing data or insights to relevant stakeholders.

Furthermore, you should implement technical mechanisms for data validation (ensuring data quality and accuracy) and data security (protecting data from unauthorized access) at every process step.

Open source technologies play a critical role here, offering robust solutions built on proven software stacks designed to address such complex use cases.

An open-source tool we often ask countries to reference is [Obsrv](https://obsrv.sunbird.org/), by Sunbird, which processes up to 2 billion events per day at peak. It’s built to operate with the highest levels of reliability with bare minimum operations effort at scale.

The functionality and user experience of open-source solutions are typically highly customizable and depend on the specific requirements and desired level of automation of the project. These aspects are context-specific to each project's objectives.

To gain a comprehensive understanding of this domain, one must consider several key factors:

1. Hosting options for the data, such as portals, websites, or servers.
2. Data sharing methods, including protocols, APIs, and file formats.
3. Data representation standards and schemas.
4. Data processing mechanisms, like pipelines and ETL tools.
5. Data analysis techniques.
6. Data presentation and visualization tools.

Initiatives like India's open data portal exemplify how to facilitate data hosting, sharing, and standardization. Platforms like X-road offer a trusted network for more secure personal data exchanges between govt departments. Solutions like Obsrv provide an integrated approach to data processing, analysis, and presentation.

Understanding these components is vital for anyone looking to delve into the specifics of data intelligence and analytics, especially in contexts as dynamic and impactful as regional migration. The journey from raw data to actionable insights is complex but achievable with the right tools and strategies. Data-driven strategies empower organizations to make well-informed decisions, enhance user experiences through personalized services, and employ predictive analytics for foresight into trends and behaviours.
