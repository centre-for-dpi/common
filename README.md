# DPI Overview

While the open specifications that created the **Internet** (TCP-IP, HTTP, HTML, SMTP, etc) and **mobile networks** (GSM, SMS, LTE, etc) were the digital public infrastructure of the late 20th century, looking ahead emerging economies should focus on the **next wave of DPI** that can catalyse innovation and inclusion.

Unlike mobile and internet, these DPI require even less complementary hard infrastructure  (wires, cables, cell towers, etc.) to scale!&#x20;
