# üîç DPI Overview

While the open standards & specifications that created the **Internet** (TCP-IP, HTTP, HTML, SMTP, etc) and **mobile networks** (GSM, SMS, LTE, etc) were prominent examples of digital public infrastructure created in the late 20th century, looking ahead emerging economies should focus on the **next wave of DPI** that can catalyse innovation and inclusion.

Unlike mobile and internet, these DPI require even less complementary hard infrastructure  (wires, cables, cell towers, etc.) to scale!&#x20;

Each of these DPI categories can create **ecosystems** to drive exponential outcomes by combining 1) the right **technology** architecture; supplemented by 2) **governance** frameworks that are transparent, accountable, participatory; and 3) robust **market** innovation.
