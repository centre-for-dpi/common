### Challenges of Current DPI Implementation that DaaS Seeks to Address

The ground realities of implementation vary not just from country to country, but also by region. Yet a few common challenges in DPI rollouts persist across contexts: &#x20;

1. An <mark style="color:red;">**inherent friction between need and speed of rollout:**</mark> the need for the DPI is urgent for people, but there are often challenges in speed of implementation;
2. The <mark style="color:red;">**local capacity**</mark> to architect and build minimalist technology infrastructure solutions may be low or vary at different levels of government;
3. There may be <mark style="color:red;">**funding or budget gaps**</mark> for execution (not just for the new software systems but also for compute/hardware); and
4. <mark style="color:red;">**Procurement cycles**</mark> may be long and tedious to kickstart progress. There are multiple hoops to jump through before a country can even test out the DPI block through a pilot. Some of these are shown below, indicating the complexity countries often face: many have a selection process to identify the team that would eventually craft the RFP to identify a final system builder.&#x20;

<mark style="background-color:green;">**These execution pains are real!**</mark> Often, initial planners are unable to anticipate the exact system requirements eventually needed in nationwide infrastructure. They feel the need to anticipate and prepare for all eventualities which is an extremely time-consuming process and often doesnâ€™t bear fruit. The future is ever-changing. The DaaS framing helps to keep the current context in mind while simultaneously allowing future innovations to be extensible in the future with minimal changes to its foundational protocols and systems. Creating optionality is a powerful strategy for large-scale digital projects.

In many countries there is no <mark style="color:green;">**demonstrated proof of success**</mark> to show others that the <mark style="color:green;">**DPI approach will work at an unprecedented scale**</mark> - when applied to a specific use case, in that context, and for those outcomes. A DaaS phase one implementation rollout can help establish this conviction.&#x20;
