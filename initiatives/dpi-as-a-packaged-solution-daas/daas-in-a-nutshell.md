# ðŸŽ¯ DaaS in a nutshell

DPI as a packaged Solution (DaaS) refers to rapid deployment of DPI, through [upgrades of existing infrastructure](cohort-1-daas-offerings/) (instead of greenfield implementations) through non-procurement routes.&#x20;

There are multiple operational modules for DaaS:&#x20;

1. Countries can choose to join the [funded DaaS program](funded-daas-program-overview.md) to receive [pre-packaged offerings](pre-packaged-daas-kits.md) of product (digital public goods with a trained service provider to support deployment), policy frameworks, program management kits, legal templates and costing models.&#x20;
2. Countries can also choose to reuse any open source product to rapidly upgrade their existing systems (for example, reusing an eSign module to add authentication on any ID) using an existing vendor. &#x20;
3. Or countries can choose to deploy an offering from a private vendor (existing or new) for a minimalist upgrade layer on their existing systems (not building a new system) as long as it does not involve a fresh procurement process.&#x20;

The reason DaaS stresses on non-procurement is to ensure rapid deployments of minimalist DPI blocks that can exponentially increase benefits to individuals and institutions in society - and procurements by governments, while necessary in some cases, tend to be a year or two long process and are not required for simple upgrades to existing systems.&#x20;

DaaS defers from traditional pilots or POCs because the infrastructure is built for population-scale from day one using country resources and capacity, and can reach full coverage in a matter of months. This is supported by the fact that DaaS applies only to minimalist layers such as authentication on top of existing ID (and not ID enrolment itself - which even on a best-effort basis would take years to cover the whole population).&#x20;
