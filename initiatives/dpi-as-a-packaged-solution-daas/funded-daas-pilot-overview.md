# ðŸ“ˆ Funded DaaS pilot overview

### Deploy DaaS in your country by competitively applying for Funded Pilots&#x20;

The DaaS pilot program is a competitive application process where countries can make the case for why they are best suited to <mark style="background-color:purple;">quickly implement and scale DPI through the DaaS module</mark> in their own countries.&#x20;

### Timelines & Actors in the first wave

Applications are open from **January to February 2024**, and selected countries will be given their <mark style="background-color:purple;">**DaaS packages as well as supplementary funding for pilot rollouts**</mark> by March 2024. All pilots will be live on the ground within 90 days after that. The pilots will operate for a period of 90 days after the go-live date, supported by funding for that time period, to help reach its goals efficiently. Post the completion of the funded pilot, the country and DPG can mutually choose to extend the pilot for more time (or another use case), or start the transition to scale.&#x20;

1. The Centre for Digital Public Infrastructure and EkStep Foundation are joint convenors of the program
2. The first cohort is being executed in partnership with CoDevelop Foundation (as a funder) and IIITB/EkStep (as open source DPG owners depending on the product)
3. The application process is competitive and only 3-5 selected countries will recieve supplementary DaaS specific funding&#x20;
4. Countries will have specific milestones and deliverables to execute as a part of DaaS to unlock each level of funding. Failure to achieve these milestones will result in removal from the cohort.&#x20;

### A Final Snapshot: Whatâ€™s on Offer?&#x20;

1. **DPI Product Packages Available:**  Auth/eKYC/ SSO on any existing ID, Digital Credentialing, ID-Account Mapper (in Identity, Payments, Data Sharing)
2. **Ecosystem Support Provided:** DaaS package (provided by DPG providers, certified implementation partners & cloud providers) and Technology Service Providers to implement the pilot.&#x20;
3. **Funding Sources**: DaaS-based pilot funds from philanthropy, Govt funders, and other sources to launch pilots
4. **Timeline to launch:** Countries to apply in February for selection by March 2024 and implementation by April/May 2024
