# ♻️ Reusable DaaS Artefacts

Regardless of whether countries choose to join the funded DaaS cohort or independently execute DPI blocks, it can be helpful to reuse some standardised DPI artefacts that can help expedite the process of execution, regardless of the DPI block chosen, the choice of vendor, or the scale of execution. These artefacts are templates co-created with the larger international DPI ecosystem to standardise the process of implementation. They can be modified as required to suit a country's needs.&#x20;

These artefacts include:&#x20;

1. <mark style="background-color:purple;">Execution readiness checklists</mark> - helps countries assess their current infrastructure, map out use-cases and stakeholders, and gain a comprehensive understanding on some of the pre-requisites to executing DPI in a scalable and sustainable manner.&#x20;
2. <mark style="background-color:purple;">Legal arrangement templates</mark> - including a draft Letter of Intent between the country and any open source provider, as well as a back-to-back Memorandum of Understanding between the open source provider and a service provider that can support in country deployment, in line with privacy, security and critical DPI safeguards built in.&#x20;
3. <mark style="background-color:purple;">Sample costing models</mark> - an indicative costing model that reflects the typical price ranges of a minimalist DPI execution by leveraging an open source product, irrespective of geography. It also outlines standard team structures based on the technology and program requirements that can support DPI execution. The costs represent extensive consultations with multiple international and local private vendors and open source products across the world, on a range of DPI blocks, based on their prior experience executing similar infrastructures in other countries.&#x20;
4. <mark style="background-color:purple;">Policy kits</mark> - sample strategy papers that outline the context, challenges, DPI recommendations, mechanisms for implementation and benefits that can be tailored to suit any country and any DPI block for rapid understanding by, and alignment of, key stakeholders in the country ecosystem.&#x20;
5. <mark style="background-color:purple;">Program rollout guidelines</mark> - highlights the recommended activities that must be conducted during the pre-assessment, training, build, rollout and scale stages to ensure that there is adequate local capacity, alignment, and momentum for the DPI to reach full maturity.

The DaaS Playbook for rapid deployment of DPI pilots has been open sourced and linked below.&#x20;

Design thinking behind the artefacts:&#x20;

1. Focused on the country's ability to **rapidly execute** without recreating standardised documents &#x20;
2. Priorities a country-first impact-first lens by including **rigorous privacy and security measures** across all artefacts in line with best practices and global DPI safeguards&#x20;
3. **Co-created with an international ecosystem** of development partners, open source providers, private innovators and vendors, and funders for global accuracy, adaptability and acceptance
4. **Agnostic to the type of DPI** block built (suitable for all upgrades to existing DPI and not necessarily all greenfield DPI implementations)&#x20;
5. Designed for **agile, minimalist country teams to mobilise larger ecosystems** that can support their vision&#x20;
