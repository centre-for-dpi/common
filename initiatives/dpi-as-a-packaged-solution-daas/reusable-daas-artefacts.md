# ♻️ Reusable DaaS Artefacts

Regardless of whether countries choose to join the funded DaaS cohort or independently execute DPI blocks, it can be helpful to reuse some standardised DPI artefacts that can help expedite the process of execution, regardless of the DPI block chosen, the choice of vendor, or the scale of execution. These artefacts are templates co-created with the larger international DPI ecosystem to standardise the process of implementation. They can be modified as required to suit a country's needs.&#x20;

These artefacts include:&#x20;

1. Execution readiness checklists&#x20;
2. Legal arrangement templates&#x20;
3. Sample costing models&#x20;
4. Policy kits&#x20;
5. Program rollout guidelines

The DaaS Playbook for rapid deployment of DPI pilots has been open sourced and linked below.&#x20;
