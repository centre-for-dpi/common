# ðŸ”† What is DPI?

The term digital public infrastructure is primarily used in two ways:

1. To describe an _approach_ to addressing socio-economic problems at population scale. This approach combines open technology standards with robust governance frameworks to encourage private community innovation to address societal scale challenges such as financial inclusion, affordable healthcare, quality education, climate change, access to justice and beyond.&#x20;
2. To describe _real-world examples_ of that approach as represented by well-designed population scale infrastructure that abide by the [principles](dpi-tech-architecture-principles/) of the DPI approach. India's digital identity system 'Aadhaar' is called a DPI, the Brazil payments system 'Pix' is called a DPI, Estonia's data-sharing platform 'X-Road' is also called a DPI and so on.&#x20;
